    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinkful: *Use this dataset of airline arrival information to predict how late flights will be. A flight only counts as late if it is more than 30 minutes late.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This large dataset (each file contains about 7 million flights) records basic information about US airline flights such as date, carrier, duration, and predicted and actual arrival and departure times.  It includes scheduled flights that were subsequently cancelled.  Our task is to predict delay amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 1: Classification vs Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two fundamental ways to frame this problem.  We could frame it as a <b>classification problem</b>, with delays binned into categories such as:\n",
    "- early (by at least 15 minutes)\n",
    "- on time (+/- 15 minutes)\n",
    "- 15 to 60 minute delay\n",
    "- 60 to 120 minute delay\n",
    "- 120+ minute delay\n",
    "- cancellation\n",
    "\n",
    "This model would have several advantages: first, it would accord with the categorical definition of lateness given by the US Department of Transportation (USDT).  (In typical fashion, Thinkful has simply got this detail wrong – from the USDT website: \"A flight is considered delayed when it arrived 15 or more minutes than the schedule.\")  Second, it could provide a fairly high degree of accuracy in its predictions.  Third, it allows cancelled flights to be integrated into the model even though they are non-continuous with delayed flights.  The disadvantages are that it limits the precision of information the model can communicate, and it draws arbitrary category lines between delay intervals, which may diminish its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem could also be framed as a <b>regression problem</b>: we predict the arrival time of the plane and subtract the scheduled arrival time to give the +/- minutes early or late.  The main disadvantage of this model is that it could not accurately incorporate cancellations, which would need to be removed and/or predicted separately.  However, the regression version of this problem comes with two major advantages.  First, arrival time is inherently a continuous variable, and all other things being equal a model will be better and more accurate if it treats variables according to their actual nature.  Second, it yields the maximum information generated by the model.  Users of a regression model can easily retroactively bin outputs into categories like those listed above; they can't retroactively get minute-amount predictions from a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nonspecificity of the prompt, and that we don't know for what purpose we're predicting delays, we should err on the side of maximum information.  Therefore <b>we'll proceed with the regression model for now</b>, and potentially take a brief look at a classification version at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 2: prediction in advance, or in-flight\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also not told here whether we wish to predict delays in advance of the day of a flight, or once a flight is in the air. Several columns (aircraft arrival delay, taxi time out to the runway, departure time) would only be known after or just before takeoff.  We could therefore use them for in-flight delay prediction, but not in-advance prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, in-flight delay prediction is almost entirely trivial.  Takeoff delay correlates with arrival delay to a correlation of r^2 = 0.93, so we can predict in-flight delay with a high degree of accuracy before creating any multi-feature model whatsoever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll focus on in-advance prediction here.  We'll define in advance as knowable before the day takeoff, so we'll be building a model that can predict flight delays by midnight of the previous day.  We will not use any features that could not be known by that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice 3: expanding our featureset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The information here is actually fairly sparse -- especially for predicting flights in advance.  We could actually obtain significantly more data from the data given here.  In particular, we could scrape data from the national weather service for the departure and arrival cities on the date of the flight.  In practice, the weather is known to a high degree of accuracy the day before a flight, so this would be realistic and useful predictive information.  Since weather is one of the main causes of delays, these data points would likely add significant accuracy to this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be useful to have a measure of air traffic busyness (normalized to median or mean departure/arrival numbers for each airport), since that is a major cause of delays that is also known in advance.  Unlike weather reports, this could be calculated from the dataset itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for in-flight delay prediction, or even just same-day prediction, it would be useful to know how many other flights have been delayed at the arrival and departure airports the day before - this might serve as a metric of bad weather that spans several days.  It may also be useful to know how many flights are delayed at that airport in the previous month (some airports may be less efficient than others).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we'll proceed with only the information included in this dataset - including air traffic busyness and recent delays at the arrival and departure airports, since those can be extrapolated from existing columns.  This means we won't scrape weather data based on the dates in the dataset - but we'll keep in mind that this would probably be the next step in making these predictions more accurate."
